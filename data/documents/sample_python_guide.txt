# Sample Document: Python Programming Guide

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

## Key Features

### 1. Easy to Learn and Use
Python's syntax is clean and intuitive, making it an excellent first language for beginners. The language reads almost like English, reducing the learning curve for new programmers.

### 2. Interpreted Language
Python code is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier. You don't need to compile your code before running it.

### 3. Dynamically Typed
Variables in Python don't need explicit type declarations. The interpreter infers the type at runtime.

### 4. Multi-Paradigm
Python supports multiple programming paradigms:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Procedural Programming
- Functional Programming

### 5. Extensive Standard Library
Python comes with a vast standard library that includes modules for:
- File I/O
- System calls
- Networking
- Web services
- And much more

## Basic Syntax

### Variables and Data Types
```python
# Numbers
integer_var = 42
float_var = 3.14

# Strings
text = "Hello, Python!"

# Lists
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Dictionaries
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Booleans
is_active = True
```

### Control Flow
```python
# If-else statements
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("Negative")
else:
    print("Zero")

# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

while condition:
    # do something
    pass
```

### Functions
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

result = greet("World")
```

## Popular Python Libraries

## Python Applications

Python is used in various domains:

1. **Web Development**: Building websites and web applications
2. **Data Analysis**: Processing and analyzing large datasets
3. **Machine Learning**: Creating intelligent systems
4. **Automation**: Scripting repetitive tasks
5. **Scientific Computing**: Research and simulations
6. **Game Development**: Creating games
7. **Desktop Applications**: GUI applications
8. **DevOps**: Infrastructure automation

## Python Best Practices

### 1. Follow PEP 8
PEP 8 is the style guide for Python code. Key points:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Keep lines under 79 characters
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add docstrings to functions

### 2. Use Virtual Environments
Isolate project dependencies using virtual environments:
```bash
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Write Tests
Use pytest or unittest to write tests for your code:
```python
def test_addition():
    assert 1 + 1 == 2
```

### 4. Handle Exceptions
Use try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully:
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
```

## Getting Started

### Installation
1. Download Python from python.org
2. Install Python (ensure "Add to PATH" is checked)
3. Verify installation: `python --version`

### Your First Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
